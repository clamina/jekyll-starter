# Introduction


This is my first post. I am writing this on a laptop. Paragraphs are any block of text that you write with *two hard spaces*. *This is in italics whoo hoo*.

Broswers read HDML files, but markdown is an easier version that the computer can translate. 

## the smaller title

This is a paragraph that I am writing. I am using Github pages.
